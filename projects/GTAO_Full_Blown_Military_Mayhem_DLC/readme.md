# GTA Online Full Blown Military Mayhem DLC

*The GTA Online Full Blown Military Mayhem DLC concept will bring a "Call of Duty flair" to GTA Online. A central concept in this DLC would be establishing a Military Platoon. The Military Platoon would function similar to the SecuroServ Service. Another central concept would be including militias from other parts of the world. The players in GTA Online don't always have to be fighting Russians. The players in GTA Online could fight Chinese, or African warlords, for example. Moreover, the typical Merryweather Mercenaries would be stylized a bit by allowing for women-only, men-only, or a combination of women and men mercenary groups to attack the players. This DLC should not be confused with [Military Services Group](https://github.com/edorejel/edorejel/blob/main/README.md#the-military-group-services) in the [GTA Online Spy Satellite DLC](https://github.com/edorejel#gta-online-spy-satellite-dlc-concept). The concept of an elite military unit is not found in this DLC. Elite military units as a video game concept are found the [GTA Online Survive, Evade, Assault, Resist (SEAR) DLC]().*
