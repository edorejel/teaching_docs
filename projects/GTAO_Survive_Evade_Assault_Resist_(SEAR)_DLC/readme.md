# GTA Online Survive Evade Assault Resist (SEAR) DLC

[GTA Online Survive, Evade, Assault, Resist (SEAR) DLC](https://edorejel.blogspot.com/2023/11/software-development-concept-gta-online_0.html) *This DLC would bring a Tom Clancy's "Splinter Cell flair" to GTA Online. I think for GTA VI (SIX), RockstarGames might bring this type of action to the players. Elite military or paramilitary units would be the central theme of this DLC. These types of units are not exactly found in GTA Online. The video game mechanics and gameplay might have to be created to simulate elite military and survival training for the players to experience. RockstarGames should also bring knife throwing (and maybe ninja star throwing) into GTA VI (Six). More generally explained, RockstarGames might enable object-throwing to more objects in GTA VI (Six). The Elite military or paramilitary unit would be enabled in free roam GTA Online lobbies. A few perks could be: (1) no police interference because the cops let the elite military unit operate on civilian territory as they please, (2) no muggings by Lamar, (3) permanent or semi-permant off-radar ability, (4) extended Ghost Organization abilities. The Elite Unit concept has to be simulated. The Elite Unit would be the only group of players in a free roam lobby with the ability to rappel down buildings (abseil) from the roof, or climb buildings using a grappling hook weapon. The Elite Unit would be the only players with wingsuit options instead of parachutes. The perks would be a few ways of accomplishing the Elite Unit simulation.*

However, for the GTA Online Elite Units, the players would be expected to attend specialized in-game training to use exclusive elite-level weapons available only to them. Once the players "retire" from the Elite Units, the exclusive weapons are not available for use, until the players restart the Elite Unit service. The Elite Unit service would be similar to the SecuroServ security service.*
